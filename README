System info
===========

zeta is an Intel NUC6i3SYB, with a dual-core Core i3-6100U, integrated i915
GPU, 16GB RAM, Intel e1000e NIC, Intel AC8260 wifi and a 932GB NVMe SSD.

The SSD is GPT partitioned:

  Device           Start        End    Sectors  Size Type             Name
  /dev/nvme0n1p1    2048    1050623    1048576  512M EFI System       boot
  /dev/nvme0n1p2 1050624 1953524509 1952473886  931G Linux filesystem root

/dev/nvme0n1p1 is /boot (vfat for EFI) with GPT and FS label 'boot'.
/dev/nvme0n1p2 is / (ext4, -O project,quota) with GPT and FS label 'root'.

The kernel is booted directly by the UEFI BIOS with command line

  linux.efi loglevel=2 root=PARTLABEL=root

We use a 1G zram device as swap to limit SSD wear.
