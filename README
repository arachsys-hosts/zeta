System info
===========

zeta is an Intel NUC6i3SYB, with a dual-core Core i3-6100U, integrated i915
GPU, 16GB RAM, Intel e1000e NIC, Intel AC8260 wifi and a 932GB NVMe SSD.

The SSD is GPT partitioned:

  Device              Start        End    Sectors  Size Type
  /dev/nvme0n1p1       2048    1050623    1048576  512M EFI System
  /dev/nvme0n1p2    1050624 1953525134 1952474511  931G Linux filesystem

with /dev/nvme0n1p1 as /boot (vfat) and /dev/nvme0n1p2 as / (ext4).

The kernel is booted directly by the UEFI BIOS with command line

  loglevel=2 root=/dev/nvme0n1p2

We use a 1G zram device as swap to limit SSD wear.
